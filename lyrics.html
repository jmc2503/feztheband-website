        <h1>Ok here are the lyrics I t ried to format them nicely</h1>
        <p>
            Black cat in the middle of the road
            Screaming out as they passed through the rows
            Blood drips down the front of their clothes
            Death comes to collect one more soul

            901 and the night is still young
            Spooks and psychos have only begun

            Catch a scent floating in the breeze
            Wolfman sniffs and he takes over lead
            Zombie follows with moans that are hollow
            While mummy steps silently out from the shadows

            Creeping slowly blending in the crowd
            Fog drifts forming their shroud
            Claws tearing, pull limbs from the other
            Howls mask the sounds of the victims pure terror

            Cold body in the middle of the road
            Bloody screams as a crowd starts to grow
            Cops yell for them to go home
            They wait for the killers but they never show

            Pitch black hearse comes driving on by
            The ghouls inside gleam with pride
            Church bells toll as the clock steals a soul
            Reads quarter past 9 what a great time to die



            Prechorus
            *Overlapping*
            They’re hungry
            They’re coming
            CHORUS
            Late at night
            No flash light
            Walk alone now your
            Locked in their sight

            Face to face
            It’s you they’ll chase
            Try to run
            And you’ll pray for the sun
        </p>

        <p>
            STUTTGART STU VERSE:
            He stands alone
            In the corner of every room
            Watching the crowd
            But never joining in the sound
            Stuttgart Stu lost his voice
            In the mines uptown
            Gone with time
            Now he’s forced to be a party mime
            He brings a clock
            Almost everywhere he does roam
            Made of chrome
            Reminds him of the days he had a home
            Bed to bench
            Lays a weary Stu in the night
            Read text books
            With funny words that sound like fooks
            VERSE 2: In his last act
            The mob watched his every move
            Sneakers squeak
            In their hearts there’s no beat
            Stuttgart Stu hits the ground
            But still makes no sound
            He gets no break
            His killers give him more than he can take

            Laid to rest is a man
            Who we could never understand
            Isn’t it sad that we never asked his name
            CHORUS:
            He wants to scream
            He wants to shout
            But his voice can’t get it out

            Words inside his head
            Are in a language
            He can’t understand

            A clock it ticks
            It’s ticking down
            His heart it starts to pound

            Words inside his head
            Are in a language
            He can’t understand

            CHORUS 2:
            Sitzt der Stumme in Stille
            Er wartet auf seine Zeit
            Seine worte klingen anders
            Aber sie sind alles, was er weiß

        </p>

        <p>Verse 1: Verse 2:
            I dug a hole You’ll make friends
            In the ground With the bugs
            Why am I Their mouths will give
            Always so down You little hugs
            Business sucks A little sad
            When no one dies About your death
            So now I have It’s either that
            To euthanize Or massive debt
            Please don’t scream Your life insurance
            You’ll make me cry I will collect
            You see that hole
            It’s in the ground
            Get in that hole
            Get underground
            cover you up
            So no one sees
            An alibi
            Is What I need
            Pre Chorus:
            I just wanna pay the bills
            Digging the graves on my own
            On lonely hills
            I just wanna pay my bills
            My debt
            Regrets
            Will kill me and you
            Chorus:
            Turn me into an animal
            Got all these holes I gotta fill
            No ones dying anymore
            Empty pockets I can’t ignore
            On and on
            My conscience dies
            My neighbors gone
            Engulfed in flies
            In this plot
            Here he lies
            Spirit floats
            Up in the sky
        </p>

        <p>Stay Home Tonight
            The rain falls
            No one calls
            Confined walls
            I guess I’ll just stare
            Out my window
            Feeling despair
            Endless limbo
            I’m Staying home for the night

            I'm missing
            And wishing
            For something
            To take me away
            To the ocean
            Riding the waves
            Never lonesome
            I wasn’t made for the night

            CHORUS
            Stuck within the memories that’ll linger
            Oh darlin oh darlin
            And now I sit in pools of my misery
            Waiting for you
            Praying for you

            The grim night
            I lost sight
            Of your light
            Plunged into the dark
            With no angel
            Snuffing the spark
            Of our fable
            I’ll never make it alone

            BRIDGE
            She was divine
            Lips of red wine
            Left a scar
            Into my heart
        </p>

        <p>Keep Killing
            I’m getting sick
            of the way things aren’t
            Gotta turn it around
            And get real smart
            Shattered glass
            Is below my feet
            My fist is red
            And flush and beat

            Don’t you touch me
            ‘Cuz I’ll blast you too
            Don’t need a gun
            But I think you do
            I hold weight
            Around this town
            So just you wait
            I’ll put you under ground

            I’ll keep killing x4


            God’s got my side
            When I need some more
            I’ve sealed your fate
            And locked the door
            Hear that sound?
            Might be your last
            Dropping bombs
            To smoke your ass
            Eradicate
            your history
            Replaced with mine
            From the land to the sea
            I don’t care if it’s wrong
            It’s right for me
            Besides
            Who’s gonna stop me
        </p>

        <p>Stuck in place
            There’s lots of evil in my head
            Im not ready to face
            Can’t move shit
            Now all my dreams are gone
            No use in hanging on
            Just gotta get along

            God
            I wanna make it on my own
            [(ON MY OWWWN)]
            God
            I’m reaping what i’ve sown
            Mud im sinking down below
            Please save my soul

            Nothing
            Grows
            In the
            Mud takes more
            Than what i’ve got to give
            My love, my life and my chore←NO!
            Lightning cracks
            The rain it starts to fall
            My stomachs in a ball
            The sludge is growing tall

            Stuck in place
            There’s lots of evil in my head
            My uncomfortable disgrace
            Can’t move shit
            Now all my dreams are gone
            No use in hanging on
            Just gotta get along
            It’s all just going wrong
        </p>

        <p>U and I
            You light the fire
            And I put it out
            You take it higher
            And I start to shout

            Chorus: Oooh
            Just talking bout you and I

            I spill your drink
            You steal my lighter
            I throw up in the sink
            You’re acting hyper
            I say settle down
            You don’t like my tone
            Now i’ve got a frown
            Guess you’re sleeping alone
            You take your aim
            I run and hide
            You’re shooting flame
            My time to die

            You light the fire (I light the fire)
            And I put it out (You put it out)
            You take it higher (I take it higher)
            And I start to shout (And you start to shout)

            Just you and I (Just you and I) x4
        </p>

        <p>Burnt up, burnt down and burnt out

            Everytime that I walk down the street
            I get the feeling that I’m missing something
            I don’t know what it is
            Do you know what it is

            No motivation and lack of sleep
            Is giving me these raw emotions lately
            I don’t know what I am
            Do you know what I am

            Right now I’m really feeling
            burnt up, burnt down, burnt out
            Right now I’m really feeling
            burnt up, burnt down, burnt out
            Oh you got me feelin’

            There’s these moments where I seem okay
            But then I never get the time to make it
            Got the world in my hands
            Lost the world in your hands

            I know I gotta get up
            I know I gotta get out
            But now I’m pushing my luck
            It’s killing me with doubt
            Going out for a drive
            Tryna leave you behind

            Find myself in the same mistakes again
            Burnt up burnt down
            Get a grip on the life I want to live
            Ooo
            Caught a glimpse of the one I miss
            Heavy heart makes me wish
            Thoughts of you will never go
            Saddest part is you’ll never know
            You got me feelin

            They’re Alive
            Johnny’s on the bus
            Shooting spitballs at me
            Then I saw something
            That i’ve never seen
            Oh no

            Staring at the Tv
            Zombie movies
            Corpses sitting upright
            And talking to me
            Oh No

            Asked that dead guy
            How he died
            Stumbled away
            With tears in his eyes
            Oh No

            If you see a dead man
            Watch your tone
            They have feelings too
            And they’re all alone
            Oh No (NaNANA)

            They’re alive
            We’re alive
            Now we’re all alive
            We’re alive today


            Greenoid Shuffle
            Do the Greenoid shuffle
            Everybody shuffle now

            Early last night I was walking downtown
            My dead end job got me feeling so down
            Heard a sweet tune blaring out of the bar
            I knew that good old shuffle could not be far


            Hop on one leg
            Not on the other
            Raise up two arms
            Now call your mother
            Let her know you’re doin just fine
            Cuz the greenoid shuffle is a helluva time


            Do the greenoid shuffle
            Everybody shuffle now

            Now I got a house with a big old lawn
            Spend my night shuffling I’m up till dawn
            If you don’t believe in the power of this dance
            All I’m saying is you gotta take the chance

            I Just Want Somethin’

            I don’t need nothin’
            I just want somethin’

            They say I gotta take my time
            They think I wait around to die
            I’ve been this fast for all my life
            I take my chances when i can

            I’m stealin all the shit I see
            It just comes naturally to me
            They got my picture on the board
            Those little problems I ignore

            Got hands so red they leave a mark
            I leave no traces in the dark
            No cop has ever caught my trail
            This Gambled money pays my bail


            TRICK OR TREAT
            My name is Billy and I’m 7 years old
            This house has candy or so I’ve been told
            Notice my bag and how it’s only half full
            You better fill it up or i’ll steal the bowl

            Trick or treat x3

            I’m dressed as Fonzie y’know from happy days
            He makes me laugh in so many ways
            Check the leather, this fudge is real
            Go ask your neighbors I made em squeal

            Trick or Treat x3


            It’s a shame I can only take two
            One for the road see how fast I chew
            Wait wait wait does this have nuts
            I gotta know, it’ll ruin my guts

            SEEING GHOSTS

            Verse:
            I lost my girl
            In one big whirl
            Tossed in a hole
            Or so it’s told

            She’s not at rest
            In one big mess
            She stalks this land
            Looking for her man

            Round midnight she takes her walk
            My heart’s in shock
            Peering through my window

            Red eyes burn into my soul
            She’s got control
            And now I know it’s over

            Verse 2:
            I’ve got no right
            To have such fright
            It’s just a blight
            Knowing what I know

            I killed that girl
            Oh my sweet Pearl
            So now you see
            Why she’s after me

            A psycho I’ve gotta be
            With apathy
            Yet no one sees I’m fearing

            The ghoul that has spawned from hell
            And cast its spell
            Onto my shaking body


            Prechorus:
            I’m so afraid I lost my mind
            These ghostly whispers chill my spine
            Get away x3 getta

            Chorus:
            Seeing ghosts in my room while I try to sleep at night
            Got my pillow and I’m holding it real tight
            My baby’s deep 6 feet down
            Now she’s coming back around

            Nowhere to go that’ll slow this dead ladies lust for blood
            Haunting shadows cast on all the things I loved
            Take a breath close my eyes
            Beg and plead for her to spare my life


            Chant:
            Get away x1billion
