                The competition was stiff but my back was stiffer.

            <br>
            <p>As fate would have it, the judging team selected Fez (spelled Fez) to open the festival. Fez hopes the
                Movin' On crowd will
                resonate with their famous message: "We have fun. We have a good time." Additional articles can be

            <p>Fez Nation attended in record numbers and brought an unmistakable energy to the battle field (Schwab
                Auditorium). Thank you to all who attended. Fez is forever indebted to those who risked their eardrums
                by listening to over 10 minutes of Fez songs. Thank you to the other bands for their catchy tunes and
                thank you to Movin' On.</p>
            <br>
            <p>On the horizon, Fez plans to launch Fezcoin, their newest---FULLY LEGITIMATE---crypto currency.
                A new 4D Fez experience is also in development for the Metaverse. Additionally, Fez will be appearing
                on the Late Late Show with James Corden on April 20th. Finally, if you would like to join the Fez Fan

        <img src="images/tydrum.JPG" id="eventimage">
        <div class="article-text">
            <p>Ty Lastname recently won the First Annual Fezmas Cheer Community Outreach Program Event Competition
                (FAFCCOPEC for short). During the Fez Christmas show at the Spice Rack, famous Fez bass player Max
                revealed
                the opportunity to onlookers.</p>
            <br>
            <p>"Look under your shoe and if there's a red piece of gum, then you just won the chance to play drums with
                Fez
                tonight," shouted Max.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Looking under his shoe, Ty screamed with delight when he found the aforementioned scarlet chewing gum
                under
                his new pair of Adidas kicks. He rushed the stage with delightment and put on the performance of a
                lifetime.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Fez played songs by all the Christmas greats like Elvis, Elvis, and Elvis. Fez then donated all the
                proceeds
                from the show to The Human Fund, a non-profit that provides money for people.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Everyone please congratulate Ty on this monumental achievement!</p>
